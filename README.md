## Overview

Golden Token V2 is the successor to the original Golden Token NFT collection on Starknet, modernized for full ecosystem compatibility and built entirely on-chain. V2 preserves the provenance of the original via a fully onchain airdrop while upgrading to modern standards and tooling.

V2 expands the collection by airdropping seven new ERC721 tokens to each of the 160 V1 holders, resulting in a total supply of 1,120. Each V2 token grants its holder one free Loot Survivor game per week, forever.

At a glance:

- Supply: 1,120 tokens (160 holders √ó 7 each)
- Distribution: Airdropped in seven rounds to current V1 holders at execution time
- Compatibility: OpenZeppelin ERC721 + ERC2981 on Cairo 2.11.4
- Governance: ERC721Votes for onchain voting and delegation
- Metadata: Fully on-chain JSON + SVG (no base URI, data URI returned)
- Art: Animated SVG instead of static PNG

V2 addresses early V1 limitations (pre-standard ERC721) by adopting modern standards and audited components, ensuring wallet/marketplace support, enforceable royalties, and native governance‚Äîwhile keeping the experience faithful to the original Golden Token vision.

## The Origin Story

The original Golden Tokens were launched on **October 31st, 2023**, alongside the inaugural release of Loot Survivor. In a true fair-launch fashion, Golden Tokens were made available through a three-week open edition mint with:

- ‚úÖ No allowlist
- ‚úÖ No mint limits
- ‚úÖ No team allocation
- üí∞ Cost: 75 games' worth of Loot Survivor

V1 Golden Tokens provided a simple utility: one free game of Loot Survivor per day. V2 Golden Tokens now provide one free game of Loot Survivor per week.

## V2: Technical Evolution & Enhanced Ecosystem

The original Golden Tokens were pioneering NFTs on Starknet, created before formal ERC721 specifications were available. This early adoption meant inconsistent compatibility - not all wallets, block explorers, and marketplaces properly support V1 tokens.

Golden Token V2 addresses these limitations while expanding the ecosystem:

### Technical Improvements

- **Full ERC721 Compliance**: Built with OpenZeppelin 2.0.0 specifications for universal compatibility
- **Modern Cairo**: Upgraded to Cairo 2.11.4 from 2.1.0 Cairo contracts
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Full support across all Starknet wallets, explorers, and marketplaces
- **Onchain Governance**: Integrated ERC721Votes enables holders to formally express views through onchain voting
- **Enhanced Security**: Latest audited OpenZeppelin components with comprehensive security patterns

### Ecosystem Enhancements

- **Increase Optionality**: Weekly games instead of daily, giving holders more flexibility
- **Expand Liquidity**: 7x supply increase (160 ‚Üí 1,120 tokens) enables more trading and market activity
- **Preserve Legacy**: Original holders receive the entire V2 supply via airdrop
- **Maintain Exclusivity**: No public mint - only original holders can receive V2 tokens
